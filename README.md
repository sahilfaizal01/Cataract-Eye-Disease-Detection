# Cataract-Eye-Disease-Detection

This repository contains some of the notebooks which I used for building a Covolutional Neural Network for the binary classification of normal eye images and cataract eyes. The novelty of the work is that, it is for the first time eye images captured from digital cameras are directly used for cataract identification. The images are collected from online sources as well as from Eye Clinics. Because of privacy concerns the data is not publicised.

Dataset Details:-

Images were found to have different types of noise and distortions, hence image processing techniques were applied for the precise classification task.
Some of them are:-
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)

Image Size:- 224 * 224 * 3 (RGB)

Deep Neural Network:- InceptionV3 (Fine Tuning Technique)

Status:- Currently, the journal is under final stage of review with Biomedical and Signal Processing Journal and is due to be published soon.

Testing Accuracy:- 93.66%
